# OI Jumper

The tool that allows you to efficiently jump to any CP problem on various platforms.

## Usage

Head to the website of this tool: [oi-jumper.vercel.app](https://oi-jumper.vercel.app). In case this is your first visit to the site, note that the default language is Simplified Chinese, and you might want to view the site in English by clicking on the language switcher on the bottom.

Select the CP platform in which your requested programming problem is hosted[^1]. Then type in the problem ID, or a search term that'll be fed into the platform's search engine[^2]. Then click the corresponding button or slam <kbd>Enter</kbd> to **JUMP** to your destination.

[^1]: If you can't find the platform you're problem is on, it's more than welcomed to open an issue or submit a pull request.

[^2]: For platforms that don't support in-site searching, we'll instead use plain old Google or Bing (depending on the chosen language: for Simplified Chinese users, Bing is preferred since Google is firewall-blocked; for English users, Google is preferred), but specify the `site` tag to filter the results.

## Contributing

OI Jumper is a static site built using Tailwind and daisyUI. This is my first attempt at using a web framework to develop projects, and I feel very good about the combo of these two.

If you encounter any trouble when using this tool, or that you would like to add something to make the site better, it's always welcomed and appreciated to open issues and create pull requests. I'll make time to review and respond, but sadly there's no guarantee on my availability since I still got school studies to work on.
